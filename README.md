TODO:
- clean up for publishing
- add card response in endpoint: https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/providing-home-cards-for-the-amazon-alexa-app.
- add prefixed to _services/alexa_ so Alexa can answer in complete sentences.
- add a db to store every request, intent, and if it was successfully responded to (for reporting and improving the service).
- create unit tests for each service
- create end-to-end tests
- check with someone at Intrinio to see if percentages should be taken literal or be multiplied by 100 (currently being multiplied).
